* Receiver spacing- Green Bay simulations, static range testing- Sept 2016 - April 2017 
- 3 locations in Green Bay
- V13-H, V13-L, several different delays
- Depth?
- Range testing was to support Lake White Fish study
** Detection range curves
- V13-H- 50% probability of detecting transmission ranged from 100-2000 meters
- Variable over time and location
** Line detection range
- Determine the probability of detecting a fish moving through a line of receivers.  
- inputs- fish movement rate, detection range curve, delay
- For V13-H, nominal delay = 300 S, 6000 m receiver spacing, mean detection prob = 0.6
- For V13-H, nominal delay = 300 S, 4000 m receiver spacing, mean detection prob = 0.7
